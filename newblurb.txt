I'm an economic and social historian, interested in the roots of economic growth, but above all in how economic growth results in widely shared gains in wellbeing. To do this I take a quantitative and computational approach to the historical record, and track how things like income, health, work, and inequality changed as economies grew and stagnated. I work historically because it provides the diverse cases we need, and the necessary long-term view at which many of these processes operate. A big-data approach is needed to make the most out of new large-scale historical microdata becoming available, and to be able to have a "broad wellbeing" perspective, which takes into account the multidimensional character of wellbeing. I construct and analyse such datasets in diverse team of historians, social scientists, and computer scientists in projects like the Historical Income Panel, CLARIAH, and the Cape of Good Hope Panel.
