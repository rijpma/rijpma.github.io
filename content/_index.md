## About me

I'm an economic and social historian at Utrecht University. I'm interested in long-run economic growth, but above all in how economic growth results in widely shared gains in wellbeing. To do this I take a quantitative and computational approach to the historical record, and track how things like income, health, work, and inequality changed as economies grew and stagnated. I work historically because it provides the diverse cases we need, and the necessary long-term view at which many of these processes operate. A big-data approach is needed to make the most out of new large-scale historical microdata becoming available, and to be able to have a "broad wellbeing" perspective, which takes into account the multidimensional character of wellbeing. I construct and analyse such datasets in diverse team of historians, social scientists, and computer scientists in projects like the Historical Income Panel of the Netherlands, [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl), and the [Cape of Good Hope Panel](https://www.capepanel.org).
